- Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/00](http://localhost:3000/00) to get to the first exercise.

## Exercises

Exercises are separated by directory in `exercises/##/`. Each directory will contain a `README.md` describing the goal of the exercise, as well as tips and comments in the `Exercise.vue` and `timerMachine.js` files.

Your objective is to accomplish the goals in `README.md`. If you get stuck, refer to the `timerMachine.final.js` file and/or import `Exercise.final.vue` in `components/ExerciseView.vue`.
